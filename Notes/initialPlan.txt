Initial Plan:


> Fully develop stencil "problem"
	> Needs specific atributes
		> bool isSolved
		> bool isFocused
		> float amountCompleted
		> int problemDifficulty (number of keys needed to be pressed)
	> Function which, when called, sets the problem to solved
	> Function that claims certain keys that need to be completed while doing the task
		> If task is not completed before the keys are released, then lose a life
		> Else, nothing happens
	> Function that checks if it is completed and changes it to green, else sets it to red
	> Function that claims attention if you have clicked on it (isFocused)

> Make the core bomb with "problems" (problems initially will liturally just be placeholder "press button")
	> Problems need to spawn inside bomb
	> Layers need to know how many problems they contain and when they are all completed

> Implement layers that spawn more problems

> Create different variety of problems
